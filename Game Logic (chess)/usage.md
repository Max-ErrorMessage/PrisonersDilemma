## Usage of .py files for game logic
There are 2 files that should be used for backend game logic calculations

### find_legal_moves.py
Lists all available moves from a given location in a given board state.

Takes 3 arguments:
1. boardstate *(as generated by game logic used in other python programs)*
2. white_to_move *(represented by the boolean 0 or 1)*
3. location *(given as a 2-digit number from 00 to 99 where the first digit is the row and the second digit is the column )*

### move_piece.py
Generates an updated boardstate and white_to_move after a given move in a given position.

Takes 2 arguments:
1. boardstate *(as generated by game logic used in other python programs)*
2. move *(represented as a 4-digit number from 0000 to 9999 where the first 2 digits are the starting position and the last 2 digits are the ending position)*
