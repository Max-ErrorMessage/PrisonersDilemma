# Twokie - Bot Playground

This repository is a Final Year project for four undergraduate Computer Science students at the University of Kent in Canterbury.

It supports [Twokie](http://www.twokie.com/), a website that allows users to submit code to play games.

The website is built primarily in PHP and uses Python because that was the prefered languge for users to input code using. CSS and HTML elements support the functionaility that PHP and Python provide.
